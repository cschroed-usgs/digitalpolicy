The Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act, as the title suggests, requires agencies to collect data to drive key agency policy decisions. This act creates a new role at each agency, the Evaluation Officer, who is responsible for reviewing and assessing the use of data for policy-related activities in the agency.

## Open, Public, Electronic and Necessary (OPEN) Government Data Act

The Evidence-Based Policymaking Act also incorporated the Open, Public, Electronic and Necessary (OPEN) Government Data Act. This codified many of the requirements under @OMB memorandum [M-13-13](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/legacy_drupal_files/omb/memoranda/2013/m-13-13.pdf). Among the requirements, it requires agencies to proactively publish [open data](/policies/data/#open-data), and all data assets must be released in a machine-readable format.

This act created the position of the @CDO at each agency. This role shares some responsibilities for technology management and security with the @CIO and @CISO, though in most cases the CIO retains the primary authority. However, the CDO may be positioned anywhere in the organization - sometimes reporting to the CIO, but just as often in an arbitrary other office, such as at @SBA where they're part of the CFO's office. Due to no funding being provided with the Act - and thus no additional staff slots - in many agencies the CDO role was assigned as an additional title for an existing staff member. For instance, at @DOJ the CIO is also the CDO. The act also created the @CDOC.

## Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act of 2018

The Evidence-Based Policymaking Act also expanded upon the [Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act](/laws/e-government-act/#cipsea). This update directs [statistical agencies](/info/agency-scope/#statistical-agencies) to assess their usage and disclosure of confidential information. It also makes it a felony for staff to deliberately disclose such info.

This act also directs statistical agencies to find opportunities to share information with each other to reduce duplicative actions.
