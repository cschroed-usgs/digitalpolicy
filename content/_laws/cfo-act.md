[The Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (CFO Act)](https://www.congress.gov/bill/101st-congress/house-bill/5687/text), as the name implies, established the role of Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) at federal agencies. However, it only formalized the role at specific agencies - known as the [CFO Act Agencies](/info/agency-scope/#cfo-act-agencies).  (Many other IT & management laws, such as [FITARA](/laws/fitara/) only target these agencies as a result of this formal assignment of financial officer authority.) At agencies not covered by the CFO Act, including all smaller agencies, there still is almost always a CFO who is delegated authority by the administrator of that agency.

The CFO Act also divided @OMB into management and budget sides officially, in the process creating the position of the Deputy Director for Management, and establishing @OFFM.

The [Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of 2002](https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-bill/4685) expanded the financial reporting requirements of the CFO Act to all [Executive Agencies](/info/agency-scope/#executive-agencies) except [Government Corporations](/info/agency-scope/#government-corporation). As amended, this requires agencies to create formal processes for financial management & reporting.
