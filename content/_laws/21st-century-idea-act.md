The 21st Century IDEA Act was written to help modernize government processes and systems. It addresses several key that have drawn public attention over the last few years.  @GSA has created a [helpful guide for agencies on how to implement the act](https://digital.gov/resources/21st-century-integrated-digital-experience-act/).

## Websites

For new government websites, the law requires:

> (1) is accessible to individuals with disabilities in accordance with section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d);
>
> (2) has a consistent appearance;
>
> (3) does not overlap with or duplicate any legacy websites and, if applicable, ensure that legacy websites are regularly reviewed, eliminated, and consolidated;
>
> (4) contains a search function that allows users to easily search content intended for public use;
>
> (5) is provided through an industry standard secure connection;
>
> (6) is designed around user needs with data-driven analysis influencing management and development decisions, using qualitative and quantitative data to determine user goals, needs, and behaviors, and continually test the website, web-based form, web-based application, or digital service to ensure that user needs are addressed;
>
> (7) provides users of the new or redesigned website, web-based form, web-based application, or digital service with the option for a more customized digital experience that allows users to complete digital transactions in an efficient and accurate manner; and
>
> (8) is fully functional and usable on common mobile devices.

Requirement 2 is further expanded to explicitly mandate the use of the [U.S. Web Design System](/info/software-development/#uswds) for all websites created after the enactment of the law.

The agency head was also required to create a list of all existing websites and submit a report to Congress detailing the costs and priority for modernizing them.

## Forms

The law also requires that by 2020 all government forms and services be made available in a digital (and thus, not-paper-based) form. It also requires that any digital forms or services have an in-person or paper-based equivalent for individuals who cannot access digital tools.

## Customer Experience (CX)
{:#cx}

The act further states that agencies should create a coordinated strategy for [Customer Experience](/info/software-development/#cx), but there are no hard requirements for implementation in the law. However, [Executive Order 14058](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/12/13/executive-order-on-transforming-federal-customer-experience-and-service-delivery-to-rebuild-trust-in-government/) does direct agencies to include CX into their strategic plans, in alignment with this law.
