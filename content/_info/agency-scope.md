Any law or policy generally sets requirements for a specific group of those agencies.  The following groups are the most commonly used.

**Note:** Although the Department of Defense is generally included in the listings below, in many cases they will have specific carveouts in the laws due to national defense concerns. Similarly, the intelligence agencies may have specific exemptions.
{:.notes}

## Executive Agencies

In most cases, this can generally be considered "all agencies" (with some specific exceptions).  This is probably the most frequently-used grouping for most law and policy.

Defined in [41 U.S.C. § 403](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2009-title41/html/USCODE-2009-title41-chap7-sec403.htm), this includes [Executive Departments](#executive-departments), [Military Departments](#military-departments), [Independent Agencies](#independent-agencies), and [Wholly Owned Government Corporations](#wholly-owned-government-corporations).

## CFO Act Agencies

In practical usage, these are also called the "large agencies," (though SBA is actually pretty small with only 3000 or so permanent federal staff, less than some [Small Agencies](#small-agencies)). This is another frequently-used grouping, and these are the agencies that get the most attention from [White House offices](/info/policymaking-offices/) for oversight.

Defined in [31 U.S.C. § 901](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title31-section901&num=0&edition=prelim), these are the agencies covered by the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990 ([Public Law 101–576](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-104/pdf/STATUTE-104-Pg2838.pdf)). This is one of the most common groupings, and currently consists of 24 agencies, including all of the [Executive Departments](#executive-departments). Most policies or laws that do not refer to all [Executive Agencies](#executive-agencies) will only cover these agencies, for example [FITARA](/laws/fitara/) only covers these agencies, and the [Federal Chief Information Officers Council](https://www.cio.gov/) (CIO Council) is comprised of the CIOs of these agencies.

It's important to note that the White House is not considered a CFO Act Agency. In practice senior White House officials from OMB will often sit as the chair on governing bodies such as the CIO Council and CISO Council. However, OMB, OSTP, and the other White House Offices are not subject to CFO Act Agency-policies - and thus are often exempt from the requirements they issue for other agencies.

## Small Agencies

The small agencies are the other, non-Cabinet independent agencies. There are many of them, but for the most part they are all very small, with only a few hundred to a few thousand employees. These agencies are frequently not included in reporting requirements and get far less attention from the [White House offices](/info/policymaking-offices/).

## Executive Departments

The executive departments are a subset of the CFO Act Agencies. These days, it's rare for a policy to only apply to these agencies. These are defined

They are often "federated," meaning that specific mission areas are separated into largely-independent bureaus which take direction from the main department. Each bureau will have their own organizational leadership structure, with a Chief Information Officer, etc. For instance, the Department of the Interior contains bureaus such as the National Park Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, each with their own CIO who receive direction on policy from the Interior CIO, but do not report directly to them. However, this is not always the case; by contrast, the Department of Veterans Affairs (the second-largest federal department) has no bureaus but three organizational units - each in itself bigger than many other agencies - but these units do not have separate leadership, and share one CIO for the agency.

In most cases, policies directed at the Executive Departments also apply to the bureaus under the departments, and the top level department will be responsible for overseeing the implementation of any such policies. As such, only the main Department offices will generally have a direct connection to the White House.

Defined in [5 U.S.C. § 101](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?hl=false&edition=prelim&req=granuleid%3AUSC-prelim-title5-section101&num=0). Currently this includes:

  * The Department of the Army
