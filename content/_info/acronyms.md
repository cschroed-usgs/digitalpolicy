description: The most popular acronyms used in government.

One of the most daunting aspects of joining government is the massive amount of jargon and acronyms. A simple phrase can contain [a large amount of history](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Darmok_%28episode%29), and the use of these are often ways of separating "in-groups" from "out-groups." As such, it's important to rapidly get up-to-speed on the local language in any given agency environment.

The summary below contains the most common government-wide terms, but each agency has its own series of abbreviations for various offices, systems, and processes. It's a good idea to ask if your agency has a list documented already - digital service teams also often create one (e.g.s, [IRS](https://github.com/usds/irs-acronyms/blob/main/acronyms.csv), [VA](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/acronyms/blob/master/acronyms.csv), [EIS](https://github.com/AlaskaDHSS/EIS-Modernization/blob/master/ACRONYMS.md)).

Many of these acronyms are initialisms, where each letter is said out loud, but some are pronounced as words - think of the difference between "EPA" and "NASA." Pronunciations are noted below where applicable.
